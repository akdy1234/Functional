    Q: The type of `baz` is `int list -> bool`. Give two different input lists,
       of length greater than five, that when you call `baz` give different results.
    A: <Your answer goes here>
    
    Q: What do the functions foo, bar and baz do? Focus on what they do rather than how they do it.
    A: <Your answer goes here>     

    Q: What would be appropriate names for functions foo, bar and baz?
    A: <Your answer goes here>     

    Q: In the foo function, what would happen if you replaced the match [x] with [_]? Motivate your answer.

    (*
    
    Q: The function foo from Question 2.1 is not tail recursive. Explain why. To make a compelling argument you
       must evaluate a function call of the function, similarly to what is done in Chapter 1.4 of HR, and
       reason about that evaluation You need to make clear what aspects of the evaluation tell you that the
       function is not tail recursive. Keep in mind that all steps in an evaluation chain must evaluate to the
       same value ( (5 + 4) * 3 --> 9 * 3 --> 27, for instance).
